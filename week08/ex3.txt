Memory Usage: The memory usage steadily increases as the program allocates 300 MB of memory every second,
leading to a significant rise in the overall memory consumption.
Minor Page Faults: As the memory manager swaps pages in and out to accommodate the expanding memory usage,
the number of minor page faults increases steadily.
Major Page Faults: The major page faults initially remain at 0, indicating that the system is able to satisfy
all memory accesses using the data stored in RAM. However, as the memory usage continues to increase and the physical
memory becomes insufficient to hold all the data, the system starts experiencing major page faults.
The gradual growth in major page faults suggests that the system is increasingly relying on the disk to fulfill
memory requests, which can significantly slow down program execution due to the relatively slow access times of
disk storage compared to RAM.
"si" and "so": These fields in the `vmstat` output represent the amount of memory swapped in from the disk (`si`)
and the amount of memory swapped out to the disk (`so`). In the initial stages, `si` and `so` remain relatively
low or at 0, suggesting that the system does not need to frequently swap memory to or from the disk.
However, as the memory usage grows, the values of `si` and `so` increase, indicating that the system is using the
swap space to manage the growing memory demands.

These findings illustrate the dynamic relationship between memory usage, page faults,
and the system's utilization of swapping to manage memory efficiently.
