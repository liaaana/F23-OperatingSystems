First fit throughput: 112.229942 queries/second
Best fit throughput: 36.946293 queries/second
Worst fit throughput: 36.984730 queries/second

Explanation of findings:
1. First Fit throughput: The First Fit allocation algorithm achieved the highest throughput, processing approximately
126.25 queries per second. This means that it was able to efficiently allocate and deallocate memory for a relatively
large number of queries in a short amount of time. First Fit works by allocating the first available block that is
large enough to accommodate the requested memory size. This simplicity and quick decision-making likely contributed
to its high throughput.

2. Best Fit throughput: The Best Fit allocation algorithm achieved a lower throughput compared to First Fit,
processing about 36.94 queries per second. Best Fit searches for the closest size block that fits the requested
memory size, which involves more searching and decision-making, making it slightly slower than First Fit.
However, it may help in minimizing memory fragmentation.

3. Worst Fit throughput:** The Worst Fit allocation algorithm also achieved a throughput similar to Best Fit,
processing approximately 36.93 queries per second. Worst Fit locates the largest available block that can
accommodate the requested memory, which can result in more wasted memory and fragmentation. This might explain why
it performed similarly to Best Fit in terms of throughput.

In summary, the First Fit algorithm demonstrated the highest throughput due to its simplicity and quick allocation
strategy. Best Fit and Worst Fit, which involve more searching, showed lower throughputs. The choice of allocation
algorithm depends on specific requirements and trade-offs, with First Fit being the most efficient in terms of
throughput but potentially resulting in more memory fragmentation.
