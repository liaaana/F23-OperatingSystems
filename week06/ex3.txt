For the given set of input data, when we observe the average waiting time (avg_wt) and average turnaround time (avg_tat)
for both SJF and FCFS, a notable difference becomes apparent. In the case of SJF scheduling, the average waiting time is
approximately 4.857143, and the average turnaround time is approximately 9.142858. On the other hand, utilizing FCFS
scheduling yields an average waiting time of 8.000000 and an average turnaround time of 12.285714.
These results demonstrate that, for this specific set of input data, SJF outperforms FCFS in terms of minimizing waiting
time and improving the overall turnaround time for processes. SJF's ability to prioritize shorter jobs in this scenario
leads to more efficient scheduling and better performance.

SJF:
Advantages:
Minimizes average waiting time.
Faster completion of short jobs.
Efficient resource utilization.
Disadvantages:
Requires advance knowledge of job lengths.
May not be practical in some scenarios.

FCFS:
Advantages:
Simple and straightforward.
Disadvantages:
Doesn't prioritize short jobs.
Can result in longer waiting times for processes with longer execution times.
Poor performance when there is a mix of short and long jobs.

In conclusion, SJF emphasizes efficiency by prioritizing shorter jobs, potentially leading to improved performance in
terms of waiting and turnaround times.  FCFS is a straightforward method that schedules jobs based on their order of
arrival, which can result in extended waiting times for later-arriving processes. The choice between SJF and FCFS
should be determined by the distinct attributes of the workload and the precise demands of the system.
