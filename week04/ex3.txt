Explanation:

For n=3:
On the first iteration, we have 1 process. This process creates 1 child, resulting in a total of 2 processes.
On the second iteration, each of the 2 processes creates 1 child, yielding 2 processes for each of the original 2 processes. This totals 4 processes.
On the third iteration, each of the 4 processes creates 1 child, once again doubling the total number of processes, resulting in 8 processes.

Thus, at each iteration, the number of processes doubles, leading to a total of 2 to the power of 3 processes.

For n=5:
Similarly, at each iteration, the number of processes doubles, leading to a total of 2 to the power of 5 processes. 

This experiment illustrates exponential growth in the number of processes as the value of n increases.
